# Controls

The library comes with a system of controls,
that helps you to control / interact with the graph, out of the box.

## List of controls

This is the list of available controls :

- Fullscreen button
- Search control
- Zoom control (in, out & reset)

## ControlContainer

A _control_ component must be include into a `ControlContainer` component.
This component takes a property called `position` which determinate where the controls will be displayed.
Values are : `top-right`, `top-left`, `bottom-right`, `bottom-left` ;

<CodePreview code={ControlContainerSource} title="Control container example">
  <ControlContainer />
</CodePreview>

## Custom render for controls

Controls have pre-defined style and icon, but you can define your own one, by specifying children component.

On the `FullScreenControl` you must defined two children,
the first one will be the JSX element for the "enter fullscreen"
and the second for the "exit fullscreen".

On the `ZoomControl` you must defined three children :

- zoom in
- zoom out
- zoom reset

On the Worker layout you must defined two children :

- stop
- start

<CodePreview code={ControlCustomSource} title="Custom render for control">
  <ControlCustom />
</CodePreview>
