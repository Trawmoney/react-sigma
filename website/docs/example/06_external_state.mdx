# External State

If you want to control the sigma instance outside the `SigmaContainer` component,
you can use the forward reference feature on it.

The reference is the instance of `sigma` used in the component,
and so with it, you can what ever you want, but MUST know the API of sigma.

Here is an example that load a graph

<CodePreview code={ExternalStateSource} title="External state">
  <ExternalState />
</CodePreview>
